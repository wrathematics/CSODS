# From Last Time
* New Homework
* Questions?

# Where We've Been
## Module 1: Basic Cloud and HPC
* Lecture 1 - Introduction
* Lecture 2 - Overview of HPC and the Cloud
* Lecture 3 - Introduction to Remote Computing
* Lecture 4 - Introduction to Containers
* Lecture 5 - Introduction to ISAAC
* Lecture 6 - MPI and Singularity

# Where We're Headed
## Module 2: Performance Optimization
* High Level Language Optimizations
* I/O
* Computational Linear Algebra
* GPGPU: The Easy Parts
* Utilizing Compiled Code

# Where's the Data Science?

# So Your Software Is Slow
.pull-left[
* Is it actually slow?
* What does that even mean?
* Do you have an I/O problem? A compute problem? Memory?
* Is it a HLL (R/Python)
  - Using vectorization?
  - Using efficient kernels?
  - Can you rewrite it in C?
* Is it linear algebra dominant?
  - Are you using fast BLAS?
  - Are you using multi-threaded BLAS?
* Can it be parallelized?

# High Level Language Optimizations
* General strategies apply
* Implementation(s) very language dependent
* Examples in R and Python

---
# Optimizations
.pull-left[
## HLL Strategies
* Compilation concerns
* Use efficient kernels/packages
* Vectorization
* JIT and/or bytecode compilers
* Fundamental types
* Language quirks (e.g. `if` vs `ifelse` cost in R)
]
.pull-right[
## Other Concerns
* I/O
* Linear algebra libraries
* Advanced hardware, e.g. GPGPU
* Utilizing compmiled code
* Parallelism
]

---
# I/O
.pull-left[
* Different strategies
  - plain text
  - binary 
  - database
* Serial vs Parallel
  - Serial hard to get wrong
  - Parallel hard to get right
  - lustre vs HDFS

# Recall: Terminology
.pull-left[
* **gemm** - matrix-matrix multiply
* **BLAS** - Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms; matrix library
* **FLOPS** - Floating Point Operations Per Second (adds and multiplies)
* **LINPACK** - Solve `\\(Ax=b\\)`
* **TOP500** - list of computers ranked by LINPACK benchmark
]

# The LINPACK Benchmark
* Solve the system $Ax=b$
  - A- $n\times n$ matrix (you choose $n$)
  - Double precision
  - Must use LU with partial pivoting
      - $A = LU$
      - $b = Ax = LUx$
* $\frac{2}{3} n^3 + 2n^2$ operations
* Solution must satisfy some accuracy conditions.
* Most FLOPS wins!

---
# Linear Algebra
.pull-left[
* LA dominates scientific and data computing
* Some uses in data:
  - PCA - SVD
  - Linear Models - QR
  - Covariance/correlation - gemm/syrk
  - Inverse - Cholesky, LU
* 1970's: LINPACK (not that one)
* 1980's: BLAS, LAPACK
* 1990's: ScaLAPACK
* 2000's: PLASMA, MAGMA
* 2010's: ~~DPLASMA~~ SLATE

* Using Video Game Hardware to Multiply Matrices
* Major players
  - NVIDIA
  - AMD
  - Intelâ€¦?!?!
* Pros:
  - Fast
  - When you give up, you can mine bitcoin
Cons:
  - Hard to program
  - Expensive
