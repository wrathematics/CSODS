# What is a Container?
>A Linux container is a set of one or more processes that are isolated from the rest of the system. All the files necessary to run them are provided from a distinct image.

# What is a Container?
A (binary) Linux program, shipped in a self-contained way.

---
# History of Containerization
* 1980's: chroot
* 1990's: VM's
* 2000's: BSD Jails
* 2013: Docker
* 2016: Singularity
* 2016--Present: Kubernetes, OpenVZ, snap, flatpak, OpenShift, AND MANY MORE

# Why Though?
.pull-left[
## Benefits
* Isolation
* Reproducibility
* Distribution
]
.pull-right[
## Common Uses
* Web services
* Dev environment
* CI builds
* Batch runs
]

* Building software is *really hard*
* Distributing software is ***completely impossible***

# Container VS VM
Containers are
* Smaller
* Faster
  - Instant startup (same kernel, no boot)
  - Applications aren't virtualized; run *natively*
* Integrable with "host" OS

# Container VS VM
.pull-left[
A container is a normal program run in a funny way

.pull-right[
A VM is an entire OS living inside your OS.

# Docker
.pull-left[
* Current hotness
* Pros
  - de facto standard
  - Incremental builds
  - Can be used on non-Linux (kind of)
  - Repos (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR)
* Cons
  - Very enterprisey
  - Doesn't "feel" unix-y
  - Driver issues (MPI, CUDA, ...)
  - Security concerns

# Docker All The Things?
.pull-left[
* Builds are hardware specific
* Sharing files is painful
* Complex builds are, well, complex
* Can't use in HPC (e.g. ISAAC)

# Singularity
.pull-left[
* Containers for HPC
* Not docker
* Pros
  - Not docker
  - Can consumes docker images
  - Containers are FILES
  - Works great with NVIDIA
* Cons
  - Not docker
  - Monolithic builds
  - Singularity Hub
  - MPI can cause trouble
