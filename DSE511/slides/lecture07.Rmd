# Public vs Private Repos

---
# Private Repos
* GitHub (and others) offer "private" repos
* You can see it, others can't

.pull-left[
## Pros
* Only work with who you want to work with
* Release to the public when you want (including never!)
* Develop proprietary codebases even!
].pull-right[
## Cons
* No opportunistic collaborations
* No dopamine hits
]

---
# Not a Strict Binary Choice
Many people use both

* Start private
* Project reaches a desired level of maturity
* Released to the public

---
# Open Science
* "Publication" jobs
* Open source is *the standard*
* Many editors/journals will reject out of hand papers with no (appropriately licensed) software!
* **I am one of them**

# Licensing

---
# Licensing
* This is an unpleasant topic (at least imo)
* But it's very important!
* First, some misconceptions...

---
# Some Misconceptions
* *Source available* not the same as *open source*
* *Open source* and *free software* are basically the same thing
* *Open source* is **not** the same as *public domain*

---
# So What Is Open Source?
> Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

.small[Source: https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source]

---
# What Is Free Software?
> Free software is software that gives you the user the freedom to share, study and modify it. We call this free software because the user is free.

.small[Source: https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software]

---
# Open Source vs Source Available
* Open source
    * Linux kernel
    * R
    * Python
    * ...
* Source available (proprietary)
    * Numerical Recipes
    * Any public GitHub repo without a license!

---
# Open Source vs Free Software
* A philosophical spat that nobody cares about anymore
* Strictly speaking, Open Source encompasses Free Software (and more)
* "Copyleft"
    * "Free" as in beer (gratis)
    * "Free" as in speech (libre)
* Free Software Foundation (FSF) vs Open Source Initiative (OSI)

---
# Open Source
.pull-left[
## Why?
* You want to
* Your job requires it
* Good for your resume
].pull-right[
## Why not?
* You don't want to
* Your job won't let you
* Bad for your resume?
]

# Some Example Licenses by Restrictiveness
* Public domain
    * Unlicense
    * "True" public domain
* Permissive licenses
    * MIT
    * BSD (2- or 3-clause, not 4-clause)
    * LGPL
    * Boost Software License (BSL)
    * Apache
* Non-permissive Free Software licenses
    * GPL and AGPL
* Non-free/non-open source licenses
    * Proprietary

# Did You Know?
* Stack Overflow posts are copyrighted https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing
* All content is one variety of CC-BY-SA
* **Be very careful when copy/pasting from stack overflow**
    * I would generally recommend against it
    * Also most of their code is wrong/bad anyway

---
# Choosing a License
* Ultimately, up to you and your collagues
* What do you want to allow? Restrict?
* What is the purpose of the software?
    * Is this a prototype for a paper?
    * Real production software? 
    * Something you want to build a business around?

---
# Why License At All?
* ***LIABILITY***
* Share only what/how you want
* You may actually be **required** to use an open source license in some circumstances
    * Journals/companies
    * "Infecting" licenses in dependencies!

---
# What About Non-Software Artifacts?
* So far we've focused on software
* All intellectual property products can be licensed
* The slides for this course are publicly available as CC-BY-SA 4.0

# Issues

---
# Issues
.pull-left[
* All GitHub repos have an issue tracker
    * Bugs
    * Tasks
    * Future features
* Searchable, taggable, ...
].pull-right[![](pics/issues1.png)]

---
# Social/Community Management
.pull-left[
* Can generally create issues on any repo
    * Sometimes these are disabled
    * Usually only unavailable for "read-only" repos
* Tag other users ("@" them)
* Use the search feature!
].pull-right[![](pics/issues1.png)]

---
# Searching Issues
.center[![](pics/issues2.png)]

---
# General Advice
* Treat GitHub like you would your work/office/job
    * Don't be a jerk
    * Careful with your language
    * Don't use a stupid username like "wrathematics"
* Not all help is wanted
* Use markdown! Especially code snippets!
* Search!!!

---
# Creating a New Issue
.center[![](pics/issues3.png)]

---
# Applying Labels
.pull-left[
* Organize issues by topics
* Probably don't set them on someone else's repo
* Highly recommend using them on your own!

* Projects
* Milestones

# Pull Requests

---
# What Is a Pull Request?
.pull-left[
A pull request (PR) is a process for integrating a change to a repo's codebase.
].pull-right[![](pics/big_think.png)]

---
# Pull Request Etiquette
* Not all PR's are wanted
* Some people NEVER want PR's (don't get me started)
* Usually best to start with an issue
    * Identify bug/missing feature
    * Create issue
    * Discuss with repo owner
    * Agree on solution
    * Implement it!
* Not strictly necessary, but may save you a lot of time!

---
# Pull Request Workflow
* Usual pipeline (distributed model)
    1. fork
    2. make changes
    3. create pull request (PR)
* For centralized codebases (e.g. proprietary ones), forking may be blocked
    1. branch
    2. make changes
    3. create PR

---
# More Detail
1. Fork the repository (copy repo to your account)
2. Clone *your* fork of the repo
3. Create changes (bug fix, new feature, ...)
4. Push to *your* fork of the repo
5. Initiate pull request

---
# Step 1: Fork the repo
.center[![](pics/pr1.png)]

---
# Step 2: Clone the fork
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wrathematics/devilutionX
```
```

# Step 3: Make changes
* This is just the git workflow from Lecture 5
* Repeat until done:
    * Add/modify/delete file(s)
    * `git add ...`

# Wrapup

---
# Wrapup
* Licensing is complicated.
* Open source (and/or free software)
    * Usually expected for "publication" jobs.
    * But not always! Double check!
* GitHub issues are a great way to
    * Report bugs
    * See if bugs are already reported
    * Track features/work
* Pull requests are how you actually get your work into a repo.
