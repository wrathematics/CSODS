# What Is Version Control?

---
# Many Names
* version control
    * vcs (version control system)
* source control
* revision control
* source management
* ...

---
# But Why Though?
.pull-left[
## Without version control
* my_project.code
* my_project2.code
* my_project_final.code
* my_project_final2.code
* my_project_final_FINAL.code
* my_project_final_FINAL2.code
* ...
].pull-right[
## With version control
* You only operate on my_project.code
* Let vcs handle changes
]

---
# But Why Though?
.pull-left[
## Without version control
```r
# I MIGHT NEED THIS AGAIN SOME DAY
# f = function(...) {
#   do_this()
#   do_that()
#   etc()
# }
g = = function(...) {
  # ...
}
```
].pull-right[
## With version control
```r
g = = function(...) {
  # ...
}
```
]

---
# But Why Though?
Standardizes good practices
* Forward tracking changes
* Reverting a bad feature
* Backups

---
# Implementations
* Monolithic - single codebase (commit is equivalent to commit + push)
    * svn
* Distributed - multiple codebases (commit separate from push)
    * git
    * mercurial (hg)
* There may be others; they're probably irrelevant

---
# Implementations
* svn is very dated; I really don't recommend it
* git and hg are very similar
* We will only focus on git

---
# What Is git?
.pull-left[
* Version control software
* Command line tool
* Originally created by Linus Torvalds
].pull-right[![](pics/git.jpg)]

---
# What Is git?
.pull-left[
> I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now git.
].pull-right[![](pics/linus.jpg)]

---
# git
.pull-left[
## Why git?
* It's verbose
* It's basically the standard
    * Lots of references
    * Other people generally know it
* GitHub is great!
* Easy to use 95% of the time
].pull-right[
## Why Not git?
* It's verbose
* Multiple ways to do many things
* That last 5% is a doozy
]

---
# File Tracking
.pull-left[
## Do Track
* Inputs
    * Text files
    * Scripts
    * Images
    * ...
].pull-right[
## Don't Track
* Outputs
    * Binary files
    * Generated files
    * knitr cache
    * ...
]

---
# Some Terms
* **repo** - the code repository
* **remote** - your repo hosted somewhere else (e.g. GitHub)
* **clone** - creating a local copy of a repo
* **forking** - creating a remote copy of a repo
* **branch** - like a local fork

---
# Collaborating
* Many remotes
    * GitHub
    * Bitbucket
    * GitLab
    * ...
* Many advantages
    * enables collaboration
    * free backups!
    * graphical interface to git's worst parts

---
# Collaborating
* Using remotes (e.g. GitHub)
* Usual pipeline (distributed model)
    1. fork
    2. make changes
    3. create pull request (PR)
* For centralized codebases (e.g. proprietary ones), forking may be blocked
    1. branch
    2. make changes
    3. create PR

---
# Using git
* Most people don't just use git
    * git + GitHub
    * git + Bitbucket
    * etc
* Handful of commands are most of what you'll ever need
    * `init`
    * `status`
    * `add`
    * `commit`
    * `push/pull`
* The web interface handles most of what else you will need

---
# When Things Go Wrong
* git does what you tell it to do
    * This includes stupid things
* It's hard to *truly* wreck a git repo
    * But it's easy to wreck it beyond *your* ability to fix
* This can be very hard
* We have a single lecture dedicated just to this
