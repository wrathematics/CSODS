# What Is a Database?
.pull-left[
* "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system" - Oracle
* Usually referring to a DBMS + its stored data
* Data is usually "tabular", but can form complicated hierarchies
].pull-right[![](pics/db.jpg)]

---
# Pros and Cons
.pull-left[
## Pros
* Data integrity
* Security
* Usually quite fast
* Server queryable from multiple "locations"
].pull-right[
## Cons
* Complexity!
    * How do you run the server?
    * How do you store data (this is the hard part)?
    * Have do you query it?
* Can be expensive $$$
* Difficult to share data with others

# Databases
.pull-left[
## Uses
* Web apps
* Buesiness processes
* ...
].pull-right[
## Absence
* Academia! (research)
* HPC
]

---
# Types of Databases
.pull-left[
## Relational (tables - SQL)
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* Oracle
].pull-right[
## Non-Relational ("NoSQL")
* MongoDB (document-oriented)
* Redis (key/value)
* Apache Cassandra (columnar)
]

---
# SQL
* Structured Query Language
* S-Q-L or "sequel"
* A DSL 
* Differences across implementations
* Simple queries are easy to understand: `SELECT x FROM y WHERE z`
* Kind of looks like dplyr (cough cough)
* Queries can be EXTREMELY complicated...

---
# SQLite
.pull-left[
* We'll be using this for examples/demos
* Not a daemon/service
* The "db" is a file!
* Strictly speaking: a library
* Accessible via R and Python
