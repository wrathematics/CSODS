# Today's Lecture
* We'll be looking at *many* utilities
* Lots of examples
* Probably less stories/opining
* More boring? Less boring? Different...

# Printing and File Inspection

---
# Printing / File Inspection
* `echo` - print a string
* `head` and `tail` - see first/last "few" lines of a file
* `cat` - print a file to stdout
* `less` - interactively view a file

---
# echo
```{bash}
echo hello world
```
```{bash}
echo a b c
```
```{bash}
echo "d e f"
```
```{bash}
echo \"g h i\"
```

---
# echo
```{bash}
echo $LANG
```
```{bash}
x=1
echo $x
```
```{bash}
echo "a\nb"
```
```{bash}
echo -e "a\nb"
```

---
# head and tail
```{bash}
echo -e "a\nb\nc\nd\ne" > /tmp/x.txt
```
.pull-left[
```{bash}
head -n1 /tmp/x.txt
```
```{bash}
head -n3 /tmp/x.txt 
```
].pull-right[
```{bash}
tail -n1 /tmp/x.txt
```
```{bash}
tail -n3 /tmp/x.txt 
```
]

---
# head and tail
```{bash}
echo -e "a\nb\nc\nd\ne" > /tmp/x.txt
```
```{bash}
cat /tmp/x.txt
```
```{bash}
cat -n /tmp/x.txt
```

---
# less
* We've seen this in class
* How does it work?
* `less some_file`
* Search with `/` e.g. `/my_search_string<enter>`
* Exit with `q`

# File Info

---
# File Info
* `wc` - char/word/line counting
* `du` and `df` - "disk usage" and "disk free"
* `locate` - find files by name
* `which` - locate a *command*
* `find` - a better `locate`

---
# wc
```{bash}
echo -e "a\nb\nc\nd\ne" > /tmp/x.txt
```
```{bash}
wc /tmp/x.txt
```
```{bash}
wc -l /tmp/x.txt
```

---
# du and df
```{bash}
echo -e "a\nb\nc\nd\ne" > /tmp/x.txt
```
```{bash}
du /tmp/x.txt
```
```{bash}
du -h /tmp/x.txt
```

---
# du and df
```{bash}
echo -e "a\nb\nc\nd\ne" > /tmp/x.txt
```
```{bash}
df | head -n 4
```
```{bash}
df /tmp
```

---
# locate
```{bash}
locate Rscript | grep ^/usr/lib
```
```{bash}
locate libR.so | grep ^/usr/lib
```

---
# which
```{bash}
which Rscript
```
```{bash}
which python
```

---
# find
```{bash}
cd /tmp && mkdir -p /tmp/example && cd example
touch x.txt
touch y.txt
touch a && chmod +x a
```
```{bash}
find /tmp/example -name *.txt
```
```{bash}
find /tmp/example -name x.*
```
```{bash}
find /tmp/example -executable
```

# Editors

---
# Editors
* `nano`
* `vim`
* And the rest...

---
# nano
* `nano some_file.txt`
* How to use it? Read the bar at the bottom!
* `ctrl`+`x` - exit
* `ctrl`+`o` - save file
* `ctrl`+`r` - open file
* etc.

---
# vim
* A "modal" editor
* Difficult to learn, but very powerful
* Not for everyone
* You aren't "bad" for not liking it

---
# vim
* `vim some_file.txt`
* `i` to enter "insert" mode
* `Esc` or `ctrl`+`c` to exit current mode
* `:w` to save
* `:q` to quit

# Diffing Files

---
# Diffing Files
* `cmp` - concisely compare files
* `diff` - verbosely compare files
* `md5sum` - check if two files are identical

---
# Setup
```{bash}
cd /tmp && mkdir -p /tmp/example2 && cd example2
echo "a\nb" > x.txt
echo -e "a\nb" > y.txt
```

---
# cmp
```{bash, error=TRUE}
cd /tmp/example2/
cmp x.txt x.txt
```
```{bash, error=TRUE}
cd /tmp/example2
cmp x.txt y.txt
```

---
# diff
```{bash, error=TRUE}
cd /tmp/example2/
diff x.txt x.txt
```
```{bash, error=TRUE}
cd /tmp/example2
diff x.txt y.txt
```

---
# md5sum
```{bash, error=TRUE}
cd /tmp/example2
md5sum x.txt y.txt
```



---
class: clear, inverse, middle, center
# Calculators

---
# Calculators
* `R` and `Python`
* `bc` - "basic calculator"

---
# R and Python
```{bash}
Rscript -e "cat(1+1, '\n')"
```
```{bash}
python -c "print(1+1)"
```
```{bash}
python -c "import math; print(math.pow(10, 20))"
```

---
# bc
```{bash}
echo "1+1" | bc
```
```{bash}
echo "10^20" | bc
```
```{bash}
echo "1/3" | bc
```
```{bash}
echo "scale=17; 1/3" | bc
```

---
# bc
```{bash}
echo 'ibase=10; obase=2; 12345' | bc
```
```{bash}
echo 'ibase=F; obase=2; 12345' | bc
```

---
# bc
