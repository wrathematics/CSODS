# Refresher: Remotes

---
# What Is a Remote?
* A copy of your git repository on another computer, accessible via the internet
* Usually with extra tools/utilities/services built around git
* Use is not strictly necessary (but why wouldn't you?)

---
# Example Remotes
* GitHub
* Bitbucket
* GitLab
* Run the git server yourself (don't recommend)
* ...

---
# Why Remotes?
* Enables collaboration
* Free backups!
* Graphical (via web browser) interface to git's worst parts
    * Merging
    * Searching
* Offers 
    * Bug tracking
    * Feature requests

---
# Collaborating
* Using remotes (e.g. GitHub)
* Usual pipeline (distributed model)
    1. fork
    2. make changes
    3. create pull request (PR)
* For centralized codebases (e.g. proprietary ones), forking may be blocked
    1. branch
    2. make changes
    3. create PR

# Credentialing

---
# Credentialing
* Remotes need a way of authenticating you
* Options
    * Username/password
    * ssh keys (passwordless!)
* Setting up ssh keys is extremely helpful!

---
# What Are ssh Keys?
* ssh: secure shell
* keys: a passwordless identification system
* key pair
    * private key: used to "sign"
    * public key: used to verify a "signature"
* Public key cryptography https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography

---
# Public vs Private
* Never reveal your private key!
* Public key can be given away safely (assuming your private key doesn't leak)
* Public keys use file extension `.pub`
* Private keys use no extension

.pull-left[
## Public key
```
ssh-ed25519 publicKeyGoesHere your@email.com
```
].pull-right[
## Private key
```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
privateKeyGoesHere
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```
]

---
# Setting Up ssh Keys
* Generate ssh key https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
* Adding ssh key to GitHub account https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

---
# Generating
1. Open terminal
2. `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
3. Use default file location (press enter)
4. Add a passphrase if you want
5. Add to ssh agent `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

---
# Adding to GitHub
.pull-left[
1. Go to GitHub settings (see right)
2. Select `SSH and GPG keys`
3. Click `New SSH key`
4. Add the key
    1. Copy the contents of your ***PUBLIC*** key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
    2. Paste into the key box
    3. Give it a name
    4. Click `Add SSH key`

# Many Features
* Public and private repos
* Issues
* Fork/PR
* Organizational accounts
* Wikis https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis
* Running a website! https://pages.github.com/

# Checking Available Remotes
```bash

```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
```bash
git remote
```
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:wrathematics/demo.git
```

# Syncing
```bash
git push origin master
```
```
To github.com:wrathematics/demo.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:wrathematics/demo.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only

hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.

# Wrapup

---
# Ungraded Homework
* You already have a GitHub account (right?)
* Set up ssh keys
* Add ssh keys to GitHub
* Learn some basic markdown https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

---
# Wrapup
* Working with remotes is a small extension of what we've seen so far
* Mostly straightforward, but be careful with divergent histories!
* You probably want to use ssh keys!
* Next time: Collaborating on GitHub
