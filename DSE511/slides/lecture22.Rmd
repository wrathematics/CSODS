# Background

---
# Scripting
* Commands we've used interactively can be put into a *script*.
* Just like R, or Python, or Matlab, or ...
* There are a few differences here.

---
# Why Script?
.pull-left[
* Reproducibility
* Automation
* ...
].pull-right[![](pics/big_think.png)]

---
# Content of a Shell Script
* Comment with `#`
* First Line
    * The top line should indicate which shell runs the file
    * It should look like `#!/bin/sh` or `#!/bin/bash`
    * This is sometimes called a "shebang" or "hashbang" (hash symbol + exclamation mark)
    * Looks like a comment *but it isn't*!
* Body
    * Can be anything you run interactively
    * Variables, logic, commands, ...

---
# Permissions
* The file should be executable e.g. `chmod +x my_script.sh`
* How to execute:
    * Relative path: `./my_script.sh`
    * Absolute path: `/full/path/to/my_script.sh`
* Can also do `bash my_script.sh` which *ignores the shebang*!

---
# Example
.pull-left[
```bash
cat hw.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash

# this is a comment
echo "hello world"
```
```bash
./hw.sh
```
```
bash: ./hw.sh: Permission denied
```
```bash
chmod +x hw.sh
```
].pull-right[
```bash
./hw.sh 
```
```
hello world
```
```bash
pwd
```
```
/tmp
```
```bash
/tmp/hw.sh
```
```
hello world
```
```bash
./tmp/hw.sh
```
```
bash: ./tmp/hw.sh: No such file or directory
```

# Variables

---
# Variables
* A named symbol containing some programmatic information
* Just like variables in R, Python, ...
* Because *the shell is your environment*, these are sometimes called environment variables

---
# Assignment and Expansion
.pull-left[
## Assignment
* Use `=`
* Naming is very conservative
    * Start with letter
    * letters + numbers + underscores
* *Don't* include spaces around the `=`
* For strings, use quotes if there are spaces
* For commands, use backticks
].pull-right[
## Expansion
* Retrieve the value with `$`
* Put squiggly brackets around the var name for safety (optional)
* Arithmetic is a little tricky...
* Single and double quotes *do different things*
* Undefined variables expand to `""`
]

---
# Example: Basics
```bash
x=1
echo $x
```
```
1
```
```bash
y=2
echo $y
```
```
2
```
```bash
echo $x $y
```
```
1 2
```
```bash
echo $x $y $z
```
```
1 2
```

---
# Example: Brackets
```bash
x=1
xx=2
echo $xx
```
```
2
```
```bash
echo $x
```
```
1
```
```bash
echo ${x}x
```
```
1x
```

---
# Example: Quotes
```bash
x=1
echo $x
```
```
1
```
```bash
echo "$x"
```
```
1
```
```bash
echo '$x'
```
```
$x
```
```bash
echo '$x='$x
```
```
$x=1
```

---
# Example: Commands
```bash
ARCH=`uname -m`
echo "My computer's architecture is $ARCH"
```
```
My computer's architecture is x86_64
```
```bash
NUM_DIRS=`ls -d */ | wc -l`
WD=`pwd`
echo "My $WD has $NUM_DIRS directories"
```
```
My /tmp has 33 directories
```

---
# Example: Arithmetic
```bash
x=1
y=2
echo $(( $x + $y ))
```
```
3
```
```bash
echo $(( $x / $y ))
```
```
0
```
```bash
echo "scale=1; ($x / $y)" | bc
```
```
.5
```

---
# Example: Environment Variables
.pull-left[
## R
```bash
x=1 Rscript -e "print(Sys.getenv('x'))"
```
```
[1] "1"
```
```bash
y=1 Rscript -e "print($y)"
```
```
[1] 1
```
```bash
z=3 Rscript -e 'print($z)'
```
```
Error: unexpected '$' in "print($"
Execution halted
```
].pull-right[
## Python
```bash
x=1 python -c "import os; print(os.environ['x'])"
```
```
1
```
```bash
y=1 python -c "print($y)"
```
```

```
```bash
export y=1
python -c "print($y)"
```
```
1
```

---
# Scoping
.pull-left[
* By default, variables are local to the executing shell
* If you start a new shell, the variable will be gone
].pull-right[
```bash
myvar=1
echo $myvar
```
```
1
```
```bash
bash
echo $myvar
```
```

```
```bash
exit
export myvar=$myvar
bash
echo $myvar
```
```
1
```

# Exit Codes

---
# Exit Codes
* Every command has an *exit code*
* Exit code:
    * An integer between 0 and 255 (8-bit unsigned)
    * 0 means ok
    * Non-zero means not ok
* Exit code always stored in `$?`
* You can utilize this in your scripts
    * `exit` defaults to 0
    * `exit 1` quits with error code 1

---
# Example
```bash
bash
exit 255
echo $?
```
```
255
```
```bash
bash
exit 911
echo $?
```
```
143
```
```bash
echo "911 % 256" | bc
```
```
143
```

---
# Example
```bash
uname -m
```
```
x86_64
```
```bash
echo $?
```
```
0
```
```bash
command-definitely-does-not-exist
```
```
command-definitely-does-not-exist: command not found
```
```bash
echo $?
```
```
127
```

---
# Example
```bash
Rscript -e "1+1"
```
```
[1] 2
```
```bash
echo $?
```
```
0
```
```bash
Rscript -e "stop()"
```
```
Error: 
Execution halted
```
```bash
echo $?
```
```
1

# Logic

---
# Logic Syntax
.pull-left[
```bash
if [ condition ]; then
  
elif [ condition ]; then
  
else
  alternate
fi
```
].pull-right[
* There is also `test`
* It's mostly like bracket syntax
]

---
# Some Logical Operators
.pull-left[
## Strings
* `==` - Same
* `!=` - Different
* `<` and `>` - lexicographic ordering

## Files
* `-e` - File exists?
* `-d` - Exists and is a dir?
* `-f` - Exists and is a regular file?
* `-r` - Exists and is readable?
* And many, many more...
].pull-right[
## Integers
* `-eq` - Equal
* `-ne` - Not equal
* `-lt` - Less than
* `-le` - Less than or equal to
* `-gt` - Greater than
* `-ge` - Greater than or equal to

See also `man test`
]

---
# Example
```{bash}
ARCH=`uname -m`
if [ "X$ARCH" == "X" ]; then
  echo "Unable to determine arch!"
  exit 1
elif [ "X$ARCH" == "Xx86_64" ]; then
  echo "Your computer is x86"
elif [ "X$ARCH" == "Xaarch64" ]; then
  echo "Your computer is ARM"
else
  echo "Unknown arch!"
fi
```

---
# Example
```{bash}
LN2=`echo "l(2)" | bc -l`
if [ "$LN2" = "1" ]; then
  echo "ln(2) > 1"
else
  echo "ln(2) <= 1"
fi
```

---
# A Warning
* When testing a variable, make sure it's not empty!
* Common pattern `if [ "X$MYVAR" == "X" ]`
* In bash `if [ -z "$MYVAR" ]` does the same
* Each of these checks to see if the string is empty!

---
# Example: Empty Strings
.pull-left[
```bash
x=1
echo "#$x-$MYVAR#"
```
```
#1-#
```
```bash
test -z "$x"
echo $?
```
```
1
```
].pull-right[
```bash
test -z "$MYVAR"
echo $?
```
```
0
```
```bash
test ! -z "$MYVAR"
echo $?
```
```
1
```
