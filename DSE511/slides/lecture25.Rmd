# What Is a Database?
.pull-left[
* "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system" - Oracle
* Usually referring to a DBMS + its stored data
* Data is usually "tabular", but can form complicated hierarchies
].pull-right[![](pics/db.jpg)]

---
# Types of Databases
.pull-left[
## Relational (tables - SQL)
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* Oracle
].pull-right[
## Non-Relational ("NoSQL")
* MongoDB (document-oriented)
* Redis (key/value)
* Apache Cassandra (columnar)
]

# How Do We Interact with a DB
.pull-left[

].pull-right[![](pics/big_think.png)]

---
# SQL
* Structured Query Language
* S-Q-L or "sequel"
* A DSL 
* Differences across implementations
* Simple queries are easy to understand: `SELECT x FROM y WHERE z`

---
# The General Process
* "Attach" to DB (open connection)
* Execute SQL query/queries
* "Detach" from DB (close connection)

---
# SQL Writing
* Writing to an existing table is easy
* You will (probably) use a high-level API (e.g. R, Pandas)
* Setting up the tables is the hard part!
* Efficiency
    * Indexing matters a lot
    * Selection criteria (`WHERE` clauses)
    * Data engineers know more about this
* We'll treat this as (mostly) someone else's problem

---
# SQL Reading
* Mostly straight-forward
* Can become unbearably complicated if you have a goofy table structure
* This will be our main focus today

---
# Some SQL Commands
* `SELECT` - extract data
* `UPDATE` - update data
* `DELETE` - delete data
* `CREATE INDEX` - create an index (for searching)
* `DROP INDEX` - delete an index

---
# Some SQL Conventions
* We'll use `UPPER CASE` for the SQL bits
* We'll use `lower case` for our data
* This is a common convention; there are others

---
# Some Basic SQL
* Read all the data from `my_table`
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM my_table;
    ```
* Select specified columns and all rows from `my_table`
    ```sql
    SELECT col1 col2 col3 FROM my_table;
    ```
* Read data matching a 'filter' criterion
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE group_var = 'gp1';
    -- Another example <-- also a comment
    SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE group_var = 'gp1' AND col1 >= 0;
    ```

# SQLite
.pull-left[
* We'll be using this for examples/demos
* Not a daemon/service
* The "db" is a file!
* Strictly speaking: a library
* Accessible via R and Python
].pull-right[![](pics/sqlite.png)]

---
# SQLite Example
1. Using R
    1. Generate data
    2. Write data to DB (SQLite file - sub for your DB of choice!)
    3. Inspect
    4. Read examples
2. Using Python
    1. Open DB we just wrote
    2. Inspect
    3. Read examples

# Packages
* sqlite - `sudo apt install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev`
* R
    * glue (optional) - `install.packages("glue")`
    * DBI - `install.packages("DBI")`
    * RSqlite - `install.packages("RSqlite")`
* Python
    * sqlite3 - `pip install sqlite3`
    * pandas - `pip install pandas`

# SQLite: Data Generation
Generate fake data:
```r
set.seed(1234)
n = 100
big_tbl = data.frame(
  ind = 1:n,
  x = runif(n),
  y = rnorm(n)
)

big_tbl |> head(n = 3)
```
```
  ind         x          y
1   1 0.1137034 -1.8060313
2   2 0.6222994 -0.5820759
3   3 0.6092747 -1.1088896
```

---
# SQLite: Writing
Write table to disk:
```r
library(glue)
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)

table_name = "big_tbl"
db_file = "/tmp/db.sqlite"

db = DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), db_file)
DBI::dbWriteTable(db, table_name, big_tbl)
```

---
# SQLite: Inspection
```r
# Warning! SQLite-ism!
query = glue("pragma table_info({table_name});")
query
```
```
pragma table_info(big_tbl);
```
```r
DBI::dbGetQuery(db, query)
```
```
  cid name    type notnull dflt_value pk
1   0  ind INTEGER       0         NA  0
2   1    x    REAL       0         NA  0
3   2    y    REAL       0         NA  0

# SQLite: Inspection
```r

```r

```r
nrow(big_tbl)

# SQLite: Closing the Connection
```r

```

```
```
<SQLiteConnection>
  DISCONNECTED

# Python
* Now we'll swap over to Python
* All the queries we ran before still work
* Interface is a bit different
    * Attach to DB like before
    * Create "cursor" object
    * Execute queries on this object
    * But mostly we'll interact via Pandas

---
# SQLite: Setup
```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

table_name = "big_tbl"
db_file = "/tmp/db.sqlite"

db = sqlite3.connect(db_file)
db
```
```
<sqlite3.Connection object at 0x7fb31c99f340>
```

---
# SQLite: Inspection
```python
query = f'pragma table_info({table_name});'
```
```
'pragma table_info(big_tbl);'
```
```python
cur = db.cursor()
cur.execute(query)
```
```
<sqlite3.Cursor object at 0x7fb31c807ac0>
```
```python
cur.fetchall()
```
```
[(0, 'ind', 'INTEGER', 0, None, 0), (1, 'x', 'REAL', 0, None, 0), (2, 'y', 'REAL', 0, None, 0)]
```

---
# SQLite: Inspection
```python
query = f'SELECT COUNT(*) from {table_name};'
cur.execute(query).fetchall()
```
```
[(100,)]
```

---
# SQLite: Reading
```python
query = f'SELECT * from {table_name}'
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, db)
print(df.head())
```
```
   ind         x         y

# Wrapup

---
# Wrapup
* SQL is a convention for managing DB data.
* Database management is really hard - beyond the scope of the course.
* Appending to a table and extracting from a table are pretty easy (most of the time...).
* Next time: more SQL and SQLite
* Have a great weekend!
