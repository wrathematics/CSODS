# What is R?
.pull-left[
* *Lingua franca* for statistical computing
    * Good for data/stats
    * Can do general programming tasks (poorly)
* Part programming language, part data analysis package
* Dialect of S (May 5, 1976, Bell Labs)
* Notable names: Ross Ihaka, Robert Gentleman, **John Chambers**
* Free software (GPL >= 2)

# Python
.pull-left[
* General purpose programming language
    * Good for general purpose tasks
    * Can do data/stats tasks (poorly)
* Created late 80's / early 90's 
* Notable names: Guido Van Rossum
* Reference to Monty Python's Flying Circus
* Python Software Foundation License

# R vs Python
* Both are important to data science
    * Python: ML, *especially* neural networks
    * R: everything else
* Both have lots of career paths
* Learn **at least one of the two** a a high level

# Calling R from Python

# Programming and Data Science
* We'll quickly lay out some basics
    * for loop
    * branching
    * etc
* We quickly want to get to "algorithms and data structures"

---
# Why Do We Need This?
* Most of your problems *are not new problems*
* There are often **known** good and bad solutions
* You will ***never*** be in a weaker position for knowing these things

---
# My Request to You
.pull-left[
Ask yourself: how does this work? How would I implement it?
].pull-right[![](pics/homer.jpeg)]

---
# Thought Experiment
.pull-left[
* I have two files
* How do I tell if they're "the same"?
].pull-right[![](pics/big_think.png)]

---
# Important Data Structures
.pull-left[
* Arrays
* Lists
* Stacks and Queues
* Hash Tables
* Graphs and Trees
].pull-right[![](pics/tree.png)]

# What We Will and Won't Do
.pull-left[
## What's the goal?
* Understand tradeoffs of solutions
* Learn "just enough" about how computers really work
* Learn some basic complexity ("Big O")
].pull-left[
## What's not the goal?
* Turn you into a computer scientist
* Make you into hardware experts
* Spend all day thinking about sorting algorithms
* Give you tons of algorithm puzzles
