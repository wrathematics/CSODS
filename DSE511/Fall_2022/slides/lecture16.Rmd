# The File System

---
# The File System
* We need to talk about "the file system"
* Not at the level of partition/format
* Structure, basic data operations, etc.

---
# FS Hierarchy
* `/` - root (top level)
    * `/home` - user storage
        * `/home/user1`
        * `/home/user2`
    * `/tmp` - volatile temp space
    * `/bin` and `/lib` - "essential"/core programs/libraries
    * `/usr` - "UNIX Software Resources" (kind of like "Program Files")
    * `/opt` - "add-on" software (often non-free)
    * `/proc` - important kernel info
    * ...

---
# Some FS Concepts
* List contents - `ls`
* Current directory - `pwd` (print working dir)
* Change directory - `cd`
* Create (empty) file - `touch`
* Create directory - `mkdir`
* Delete file/directory - `rm` (remove)
* Rename file/directory - `mv` (move)

---
# Some FS Concepts
* Absolute paths
    * `cd /tmp`
    * `cd /home/my_username`
* Relative paths
    * `cd ..`
    * `mkdir ./example`
* Combining the two
    * `mv /tmp/x .`

# Working With Files: The Basics
* Basic examination tools
  * `cat`
  * `head` and `tail`
  * `less`
* Editors
  * `nano` / `pico`
  * `vim`
  * `emacs`

# Permissions

---
# Permissions
* Different users have different file permissions
* Remember: *NIX is multi-user!
* User
    * reads/writes to user space and tmp
    * reads/executes various bin/lib paths
* root reads/writes everywhere!

---
# Recall Our 'ls -al' Example
```bash
ls -al
```
```
drwxrwxr-x   2 mschmid3  mschmid3 4096  Oct 16 15:49 .
drwxrwxrwt 107     root      root 36864 Oct 16 15:49 ..
-rw-rw-r--   1 mschmid3  mschmid3     0 Oct 16 15:49 x
```

---
# Permissions
```
---     ---     ---
rwx     rwx     rwx
user    group   other
```

* `r` - read access
* `w` - write access
* `x` - executable (permissions)
* `-` - permission is lacking

---
# Some Notes on Permissions
* If you don't have permission to execute a program, you can't run it
* Even if it's a perfectly legitimate binary executable!
* "Wide open" permissions (`777`) are a bad idea, always
* root sees all!
* This stuff actually gets kind of complicated...

---
# Changing Permissions
Use `chmod`
.pull-left[
## Shorthand
* Give read access: `chmod +r some_file`
* Give write access: `chmod +w some_file`
* Give execution access: `chmod +x some_file`
* Remove by `s/+/-/`
].pull-right[
## Octals
* A binary triple (number from 0 to 7)
* Defines a file mode `rwx`
* In the triple: 1 means "allowed" 0 means "not allowed"
* $4_{10} = 100_{2}$ - `r--`
* $6_{10} = 110_{2}$ - `rw-`

# Permissions Example
```bash
mkdir test
cd test
touch x
chmod 600 x
ls -al x
```
```
-rw------- 1 mschmid3 mschmid3 0 Oct 16 15:43 x
```
```bash
chmod 640 x
ls -l x
```
```
-rw-r----- 1 mschmid3 mschmid3 0 Oct 16 15:43 x

# Pipes and Redirection

---
# Pipes and Redirection
* Output from programs can be "redirected"
    * To files
    * To other programs
* "Standard output" and "standard error" are different

---
# Redirecting to Files
.pull-left[
## Standard Output
```bash
Rscript -e "1+1" > /tmp/output.txt
cat /tmp/output.txt
```
```
[1] 2
```
].pull-right[
## Standard Error
```bash
Rscript -e "stop()" > /tmp/output.txt
```
```
Error: 
Execution halted
```
```bash
cat /tmp/output.txt 
```
```bash
Rscript -e "stop()" 2> /tmp/output.txt
cat /tmp/output.txt 
```
```
Error: 
Execution halted
```
]

---
# Redirecting to Files
```bash
Rscript -e "1+1; stop()" > /tmp/output.txt
```
```
Error: 
Execution halted
```
```bash
cat /tmp/output.txt 
```
```
[1] 2
```
```bash
Rscript -e "1+1; stop()" 2> /tmp/output.txt
```
```
[1] 2
```
```bash
cat /tmp/output.txt 
```
```
Error: 
Execution halted
```

---
# Redirecting to Files
```bash
Rscript -e "1+1; stop()" &> /tmp/output.txt
cat /tmp/output.txt
```
```
[1] 2
Error: 
Execution halted
```

---
# Pipes
* Can "pass the output" to a file
* Can also pass it to a program
* Use the pipe `|` (`shift` + `\` on US keyboard)
* Sort of like R's native `|>` or magrittr's `%>%`

---
# Pipes
```bash
Rscript -e "1+1; stop()" | head -n 1
```
```
[1] 2
Error: 
Execution halted
```
```bash
Rscript -e "1+1; stop()" 2>&1 | head -n 1
```
```
[1] 2
```

---
# Pipes
```bash
Rscript -e "rnorm(1)" | wc
```
```
      1       2      13
```
```bash
Rscript -e "rnorm(1)" | wc -c
```
```
13
```

# An Observation
.pull-left[
* The shell is a powerful interactive inspection tool
* Data science is an interactive inspection job!
].pull-right[![](pics/homer.jpeg)]

---
# Logical Operators
* There are logical operators for programs
* `&&` and `||`
* Don't confuse `|` with `||`!
* I use `&&` as a shorthand for "and then do this other thing"
* We'll return to these later

# Some Useful Tricks

---
# Tab Completion
* The shell supports tab completion
* This can be made case-insensitive (see TODO)
* ALWAYS MASH TAB

---
# Control Characters
* `ctrl`+`c` - "breaks" running program; resets what you're typing
* `ctrl`+`d` - exits the current shell
* `ctrl`+`l` - clears screen
* `ctrl`+`r`
    * Searches history
    * I generally use `history | less`
* `ctrl`+`z`
    * "Stops" a program
    * Use `fg` to bring it back!

---
# Checking Command History
```bash
history | tail
```
```
 1992  man sh
 1993  man ls
 1994  ls --color=always
 1995  ls
 1996  ls ..
 1997  ls --color=always ..
 1998  ls --color=never ..
 1999  cd bin
 2000  cat buildrd
 2001  history | tail
```

---
# Foreground and Background
```bash
R
```
```r
x = 1
# I press ctrl+z here

# Wrapup
* A bit of a whirlwind...
* Working with files is where the shell really shines.
* Pipes and redirection are extremely powerful: more on this later!
* We've seen some helpful utilities: `head`, `cat`, ...
* Next time: more shell utilities
