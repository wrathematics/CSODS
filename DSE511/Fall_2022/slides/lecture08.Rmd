# Staging and File Editing

---
# Some Common Problems with Staging and File Editing
* What if you stage the wrong file?
    * Maybe you changed your mind
    * Maybe you accidentally did `git add .`
* What if you want to throw away your changes?
    * Maybe it just doesn't work and you want to start over

Changes to be committed:

# Editing Commit
* What if you wrote the wrong thing?
* What if you added the wrong thing(s)?

Important caveat: we're assuming you haven't pushed yet!

---
# Amend
* `git commit --amend` -- ADD to commit
* `git reset --soft HEAD~1` -- restore previous commit to staging

# Disagreements with Remotes
* What if the local has "the truth"?
* What if the remote has "the truth"?
* ~~What if both have "the truth"?~~
    * AKA we want to merge
    * Handled separately

---
# Making Remote Agree with Local
Scenario:
* We add things we didn't mean to (see last section)
* We accidentally pushed!
* We undo locally (as in last section) ...
* Now what?

---
# Making Remote Agree with Local
```bash
git push -f origin master
```

Be careful with this!

---
# Making Local Agree with Remote
Scenario:
* We're working off of master instead of another branch
* We added some things
* It's not really working
* How do we abandon this?

---
# We've Got Some Options
* Have we not been making commits?
    * `git reset`
* Have we been making commits?
    * Purge commits as in previous section
    * Is there a "force pull"?

---
# Force Pull
```bash
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
