> Garland thought it would be an easy fix. She asked each student where they'd
> saved their project. Could they be on the desktop? Perhaps in the shared
> drive? But over and over, she was met with confusion. "What are you talking
> about?" multiple students inquired. Not only did they not know where their
> files were saved — they didn’t understand the question.

> Gradually, Garland came to the same realization that many of her fellow
> educators have reached in the past four years: the concept of file folders and
> directories, essential to previous generations' understanding of computers, is
> gibberish to many modern students.
