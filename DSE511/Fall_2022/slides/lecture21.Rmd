# awk
* A very powerful tool!
* If you can figure out how to use it...
* Named after its authors Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan.
* Technically its own DSL

---
# awk
.pull-left[
## CLI Tool
```bash
awk 'BEGIN{print "hello world"}'
```
].pull-right[
## Programs
```bash
cat hw.awk
```
```
BEGIN {
  print "hello world"
}
```
```bash
awk -f hw.awk
```
```
hello world
```
]

---
# awk
```{bash}
awk '$0 ~ /,TYS,/' ~/sw/data/airlines/csv/1987.csv | head
```

---
# awk
```{bash}
awk 'BEGIN{FS=",";OFS="\t"}{$1=$1; print}' ~/sw/data/airlines/csv/1987.csv | head
```

---
# awk
```{bash}
awk 'BEGIN{FS=",";OFS="\t"}{$1=$1;print $17, $18}' ~/sw/data/airlines/csv/1987.csv | head
```

---
# awk
```{bash}
awk 'BEGIN{FS=",";OFS="\t"}{$1=$1;print $17, $18}' ~/sw/data/airlines/csv/1987.csv | \
  grep TYS | head
```

---
# awk
```{bash}
awk 'BEGIN{FS=",";OFS="\t"}{$1=$1;print $17, $18}' ~/sw/data/airlines/csv/1987.csv | \
  grep TYS | sort | uniq -c
```

# awk
* Can do A LOT more
* We're not going to show that off
* My take:
    * Can be helpful for some quick CLI operations
    * For data science: usually better off using R or Pandas
* Where to learn more:
    * AWK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK
    * The GNU AWK (gawk) User's Guide https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html

# make

---
# make
* "[A] build automation tool" - Wikipedia
* A workflow tool
* Often reserved for compiled languages
    * C
    * Fortran
    * ...
* Has many uses though!

---
# Example
```makefile
hello:
	Rscript -e "cat('hello world\n')"
```
```bash
make
```
```
Rscript -e "cat('hello world\n')"
hello world
```

---
# Some Rules
* A makefile is made up of *rules*
* A rule is made up of *targets*, *pre-requisites*, and *recipes*
* Rules should go into `Makefile`
    * Must be named *exactly* `Makefile`
    * Or specify the file name `make -f mymakefile`
* All rules must look like this
    ```makefile
    target: pre-requisite
    TAB recipe
    ```
* A recipe can be basically anything
* To make a specific target type `make target_name`
* The first line will automatically run if you just type `make`

# Some Observations
* Each rule is like a little function
* Rules probably shouldn't be *overly* complicated
* `make` automatically resolves the execution order, once pre-requisites are specified
* We're not yet taking advantage of one of its best features...

---
# (Re-)Generating Targets
* `make` can automatically check if a file needs to be re-generated
* Based on timestamps (if output older than modification...)
* One of its best features!
* But you have to name things "correctly"
    * An output is a target is an output
* Can force rebuilds with `.PHONY`
    * `.PHONY: all clean`

---
# Example
```makefile
export SHELL=/usr/bin/bash
all: print_results

iris.csv:
	Rscript -e "write.csv(iris, file = 'iris.csv')"

col.txt: iris.csv
	awk 'BEGIN{FS=","}{if(NR!=1){print $$6}}' iris.csv > col.txt

summary.txt: col.txt
	cat col.txt | sort | uniq -c > summary.txt

print_results: summary.txt
	cat summary.txt

clean:
	rm -rf iris.csv summary.txt col.txt
```

---
# Example
```bash
make
```
```
Rscript -e "write.csv(iris, file = 'iris.csv')"
awk 'BEGIN{FS=","}{if(NR!=1){print $6}}' iris.csv > col.txt
cat col.txt | sort | uniq -c > summary.txt
cat summary.txt
     50 "setosa"
     50 "versicolor"
     50 "virginica"
```
```bash
make
```
```
cat summary.txt
     50 "setosa"
     50 "versicolor"
     50 "virginica"
```

# Other Features
* Variables
* Sourcing other makefiles
* Wildcards
* Built-in and automatic recursion!
* Can even run things in parallel! (`make -j`)

# Wrapup
* `awk` is very powerful, but you're probably better off just using R/Python most of the time.
* Your workflow tool probably isn't as good as `make`
* Next time: Shell Scripting (Part 1 of 2)
