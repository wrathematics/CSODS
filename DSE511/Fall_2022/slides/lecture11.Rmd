# Announcements
* Nothing unresolved from last time
* Homework is live!
    * Due date moved to Wed Oct 5 (midnight)
    * `fetch` vs `pull`
    * New homework *not* next week!
* Next week is fall break!
    * No class Thursday Oct 6
* Questions?

# Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms

---
# Data Structures and Algorithms
* Multi-course CS topic
* CS talk endlessly about sorting algorithms
* Also obsessed with trees for some reason
* For this course
    * Staying mostly high level (arrays are an exception)
    * Only what's (mostly) relevant for data science

---
# Some Important Data Structures for Data Science
* Arrays
* Dataframe
* Hash tables
* Network/tree structures

---
# What's The Point?
* There are often *good* and *bad* ways to do things on a computer
* How do you know?
* Define "good" and "bad"?
* How can you even tell?

---
# Complexity
* "Big O"
* Describes asymptotic behavior of a function
* Used in CS to understand runtime behavior as data grows
* More on this later

---
# Specification vs Implementation
* Some data structures are "abstract"
* Implemented using other data structures!
* Example: a queue
    * Receives data FIFO
    * `pop()` removes the first element
    * `push()` adds element to the back
    * Can implement via linked list, hash table, array, ...
* Example: a dictionary
    * Key/value storage
    * Can be implemented via hash table (and others)

# Fundamental Type

---
# Fundamental Type
* How is data *actually* stored in memory?
* Computers don't know fancy things
    * Dataframes
    * Lists
    * Hash tables
    * Graphs
* Computers know *blocks of memory*
* But blocks of *what*?

---
# Important Fundamental Types
* `int` - integer, at least 4 bytes
* `float` - floating point number, exactly 4 bytes
* `double` - floating point number, exactly 8 bytes
* `char` - a character (part of a string), usually 1 byte

---
# Fundamental Types in R and Python
* Most computation (R, Python) automatically in double precision
* 32-bit Float:
  - half the memory
  - twice as fast (roughly)
  - not as accurate
* Python
  - Supported in numpy
  - `np.random.rand(3).astype('f')`
  - `np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype='f')`
* R
  - float package https://cran.r-project.org/package=float
  - fmlr package https://hpcran.org/packages/fmlr/index.html

# Arrays

---
# What Is An Array?
* A contiguous block of memory
* A "collection" of data of *the same fundamental type*
    * An array of numbers
    * An array of strings
    * An array of *pointers* (lists in R!)
* The data structure that powers linear algebra
    * Numeric arrays

---
# Linear Algebra
.pull-left[
* LA dominates scientific and data computing
* Some uses in data:
  - PCA - SVD
  - Linear Models - QR
  - Covariance/correlation - gemm/syrk
  - Inverse - Cholesky, LU
* 1970's: LINPACK (not that one)
* 1980's: BLAS, LAPACK
* 1990's: ScaLAPACK
* 2000's: PLASMA, MAGMA
* 2010's: ~~DPLASMA~~ SLATE

# Some Terminology
.pull-left[
* **gemm** - matrix-matrix multiply
* **BLAS** - Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms; matrix library
* **FLOPS** - Floating Point Operations Per Second (adds and multiplies)
* **LINPACK** - Solve `\\(Ax=b\\)`
* **TOP500** - list of computers ranked by LINPACK benchmark

# Arrays
.pull-left[
* How do we get from an array to a matrix?
* Recall: arrays are *contiguous blocks of memory*

* Assume $X$ is $m\times n$ matrix
* Use 0-based indexing

# Multi-Dimensional Arrays
* Assume $X$ is an $n_1\times n_2\times n_3$ array
* Use 0-based indexing

# Wrapup
* Fundamental types
    * There are many
    * For data science, you'll probably stick to `int`, `float`, and `double`
* Arrays power almost everything in data science!
    * Linear models
    * Dimension reduction
    * Fancy neural network models
    * ...
