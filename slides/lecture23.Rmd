# An Interesting Puzzle
.pull-left[
* Goal
  - build the covariance matrix
  - compute its Cholesky factor
* Works fine
  - on my laptop
  - on my EC2 box
  - on several other EC2 boxes
  - in a container
  - outside the container
* Where it doesn't work
  - Exactly one runtime environment

# What Actually Goes Wrong
```
Error in chol.default(x) : 
  the leading minor of order 19 is not positive definite
```

Problem: can't access the data!

# An Idea
From https://nhigham.com/2021/02/16/diagonally-perturbing-a-symmetric-matrix-to-make-it-positive-definite/

```r
jitter = abs(min(eigen(cov_mat, only.values=TRUE)$values))
diag(cov_mat) = diag(cov_mat) + jitter
```

Problem:
* My machine: `jitter = 5.23178e-14`
* The problem machine: `jitter = 47.50922`

# Solution
* Give up
* Get the data
* **Discover the data is the same!**

# Another Idea
Check the CPU
```r
readLines("/proc/cpuinfo")
```

# Hardware Has AVX-512

Solution:
```
update-alternatives --set libblas.so-x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/blas/libblas.so
