# Using Video Game Hardware to Multiply Matrices
.pull-left[
* AKA GPGPU
* Not just for video games and mining bitcoin anymore!
* Major players
  - NVIDIA
  - AMD
  - Intelâ€¦?!?!
* Pros:
  - Fast
  - When you give up, you can mine bitcoin
Cons:
  - Hard to program
  - Expensive

# DOE Jargon
.pull-left[
* leadership - really big jobs
* capability - big jobs
* capacity - many jobs
* Allocations
  - INCITE - leadership
  - ALCC - things DOE likes
  - DD - small jobs the center likes

# Linear Algebra
.pull-left[
* LA dominates scientific and data computing
* Some uses in data:
  - PCA - SVD
  - Linear Models - QR
  - Covariance/correlation - gemm/syrk
  - Inverse - Cholesky, LU
* 1970's: LINPACK (not that one)
* 1980's: BLAS, LAPACK
* 1990's: ScaLAPACK
* 2000's: PLASMA, MAGMA
* 2010's: ~~DPLASMA~~ SLATE

# The LINPACK Benchmark
* Solve the system $Ax=b$
  - A- $n\times n$ matrix (you choose $n$)
  - Double precision
  - Must use LU with partial pivoting
      - $A = LU$
      - $b = Ax = LUx$
* $\frac{2}{3} n^3 + 2n^2$ operations
* Solution must satisfy some accuracy conditions.

## CPU
* double
  - Best n=39000 t=200.030
  - Theoretical Peak 217 GFLOPS
  - LINPACK 197.715 GFLOPS
* float
  - Best n=45000 t=156.066
  - Theoretical Peak 434 GFLOPS
  - LINPACK 389.285 GFLOPS
]
.pull-right[
## GPU
* double n=28000 t=58.444 GFLOPS=250.433
* float n=36000 t=4126.614 GFLOPS=4126.614
]

This means Summit is 487,156x more powerful than my desktop!

# History
.pull-left[
* 1960's: Mainframe time sharing
* 1970-80's: Dumb terminals
* 1990's: Virtualization invented
* 2006: AWS launched
* 2015: Docker created
]
.pull-right[![](pics/02/mainframe.jpeg)]

We will discuss virtualization and Docker in depth in a later lesson.

---
# SERVICES, SERVICES, SERVICES!
* Think of a sequence of letters and numbers
* It's probably an Amazon product
* (Ungraded) Homework:
  - Find a random AWS service
  - Try to understand what it does
  - (Bonus) No crying

# In This Class
We will restrict attention to EC2 ("someone else's computer")

# HPC vs The Cloud

---
# How Are They Similar?
.pull-left[
* Somebody else's computer
* Lots of jargon
* Entire career paths
* Can be hard to use
* Tech stacks more similar than most realize
]
.pull-right[![](pics/02/the_same.jpg)]

---
# How Are They Different?
* Privileges (user vs root)
* Salaries, job growth/potential, etc
* Academia vs Industry
* "Free" (taxes) vs you pay
* Some non-intersecting tech stacks
    - cloud: HDFS, databases, web, ...
    - HPC: HDF5, binary files, Fortran, ...

---
# Other Compute Models
* Your computer
* "The office quasi-cluster"
* Edge computing

---
# Next Time
* Computing on remote systems
  - ~30 minutes lecture
  - live tutorial component on ISAAC and/or AWS
* Assignment 1 due tonight
* No new assignments
